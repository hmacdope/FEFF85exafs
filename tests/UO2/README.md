# Feff85EXAFS example: uraninite, UO2

This is a data-bearing example, thus the tests will cover both the
computation and the results of the analysis.

Uraninite is a simple, cubic structure with uranium octahedrally
coordinated by oxygen.  It is included as an example of an f-electron
system.

The nonparticle uraninite data was measured at APS 10ID and kindly
provided by Shelly Kelly.  The data test follows her fitting model
from [DOI: 10.1021/es0208409](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es0208409).
