# Feff85EXAFS example: Lanthanum cuprate, polarization perpendicular to the z-axis

This is not a data-bearing example, thus the tests will only cover the
computation.

This is La2CuO4, an orthorhombic crystal with the oxygen octahedron
around the copper atom elongated in the z direction.  In the plane,
there are 4 Cu-O scatterers at 1.90 angstrom.  In the z direction,
there are two Cu-O scatterers at 2.43 angstrom.

This tests making a polarizion dependent Feff calculation.  See also
the LCO-para test which uses the same material to test polarization
without ellipticipty.
