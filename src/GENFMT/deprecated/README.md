# Deprecated files in GENFMT

These deprecated files are the various `.h` header files used to
define the common blocks that were used to pass information between
the parts of genfmt.

For feff8l, the use of common blocks was removed in favor of
explicit argument passing.

The folder will likely be removed at some future time.
